```ts
const IDLE_SNAPSHOT: RunSnapshot;
```

Defined in: [index.ts:49](https://github.com/kucukkanat/mithril/blob/1e1588b814f302666212314c3d2253f86a5155e3/packages/react/src/index.ts#L49)

The snapshot for a component with no run yet — an empty transcript. Returned by useRun when its
source is `undefined`, so a component can call the hook unconditionally before a run has started.
