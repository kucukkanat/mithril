```ts
type JsonValue = 
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | readonly JsonValue[]
  | {
[k: string]: JsonValue;
};
```

Defined in: packages/core/src/protocol/primitives.ts:12

Any value that is both JSON-safe and structured-clone-safe.

## Remarks

Excludes functions, class instances, `bigint`, and `Date`. Every value that
crosses the wire — event payloads, tool input/output, suspension payloads —
is one of these.
